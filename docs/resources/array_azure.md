# cbs_array_azure Resource

Allows the deployment and management of a Cloud Block Store instance on Azure. The instance is deployed as an Azure Managed Application.

Refer to the [deployment guide](https://support.purestorage.com/FlashArray/PurityFA/Cloud_Block_Store/Cloud_Block_Store_Deployment_and_Configuration_Guide_for_Azure) for information on how to configure the Azure environment for the CBS instance.

~>Along with the infrastructure components defined in the deployment guide, an [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/)
is required to deploy Cloud Block Store in Azure using Terraform. An existing Key Vault may be used or a new
one can be created for the array. Multiple arrays may reuse the same Key Vault. Any Azure account
that wishes to use Terraform to perform management operations on the array must be granted `Get`,
`Set`, `Delete`, `List`, and `Recover` permissions on secrets within the Key Vault. All secrets created
or accessed by the CBS Terraform Provider will use a `cbs-` prefix. An example Key Vault creation using the
`azurerm_key_vault` resource from the [azurerm provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs)
is shown below.

~>In order to set up long term management of new arrays, the provider must obtain access to the array
during deployment in order to obtain management credentials. In order to accomplish this, the provider
must be supplied a private SSH key, either a file path to the key with the `pureuser_private_key_path`
parameter or the key text itself with the `pureuser_private_key` parameter. The management credentials
are stored in the Azure Key Vault that is specified by the `key_vault_id` parameter (see the above
note for more information about the key vault). To retrieve the credentials, the provider requires
access to the management port of the array, and therefore the machine running Terraform *must* be
able to access the management subnet used for the array.

~>Updates are currently not supported for this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
// retrieves information about the configuration of the azurerm provider
// The client configuration used for the "cbs" provider must match the client configuration used
// for the "azurerm" provider, otherwise the "cbs" provider will not be able to access the key vault.
data "azurerm_client_config" "client_config" {}

// Key Vault name must be globally unique
resource "random_id" "vault_id" {
    byte_length = 8
}
