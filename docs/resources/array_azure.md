# cbs_array_azure Resource

Allows the deployment and management of a Cloud Block Store instance on Azure. The instance is deployed as an Azure Managed Application.

The instance is deployed at Purity version 6.1.6.

Refer to the [deployment guide](https://support.purestorage.com/FlashArray/PurityFA/Cloud_Block_Store/Cloud_Block_Store_Deployment_and_Configuration_Guide_for_Azure) for information on how to configure the Azure environment for the CBS instance.

!>Currently, destroying the Terraform resource **will not** deactivate the CBS instance. Due to this,
we recommend that you deactivate the instance from inside the array itself. For information on how
to do this, refer to the [relevant section](https://support.purestorage.com/FlashArray/PurityFA/Cloud_Block_Store/Cloud_Block_Store_Deployment_and_Configuration_Guide_for_Azure#Removing_Cloud_Block_Store) of the guide. If the instance is destroyed by another
method than the one outlined in the guide, including `terraform destroy`, then you must contact
Pure Storage Support in order to deactivate the instance.

~>Updates are currently not supported for this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "cbs_array_azure" "azure_instance" {

    array_name = "terraform-example-instance"

    location = "location_xxxx"
    resource_group_name = "resource_xxxx"
    license_key = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx"
    log_sender_domain = "example-company.org"
    alert_recipients = ["admin1@example-company.org", "admin2@example-company.org"]
    array_model = "V10MUR1"
    zone = 1
    virtual_network = "VN-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

    management_subnet = "SN-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    system_subnet = "SN-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    iscsi_subnet = "SN-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    replication_subnet = "SN-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

    management_resource_group = "management_resource_xxxx"
    system_resource_group = "system_resource_xxxx"
    iscsi_resource_group = "iscsi_resource_xxxx"
    replication_resource_group = "replication_resource_xxxx"

    jit_approval {
        approvers {
              groups = ["group_xxxx"]
        }
