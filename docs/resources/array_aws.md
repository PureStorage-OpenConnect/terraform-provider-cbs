# cbs_array_aws Resource

Allows the deployment and management of a Cloud Block Store instance on AWS. The instance is deployed as a CloudFormation stack.

Please refer to the [deployment guide](https://support.purestorage.com/FlashArray/PurityFA/Cloud_Block_Store/Cloud_Block_Store_Deployment_and_Configuration_Guide_for_AWS) for information on how to configure the AWS environment for the CBS instance.

!>Currently, destroying the Terraform resource **will not** deactivate the CBS instance. The instance
will have to be deactivated manually once the resource has been destroyed. Please see the [deactivation guide](https://support.purestorage.com/FlashArray/PurityFA/Cloud_Block_Store/Cloud_Block_Store_Manual_Deactivation_Workflow)
for information on how to deactivate instances.

~>Updates are currently not supported for this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "cbs_array_aws" "cbs_example" {

    array_name = "terraform-example-instance"

    deployment_template_url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmp-fulfillment-cf-templates-prod/4ea2905b-7939-4ee0-a521-d5c2fcb41214.2713e2df-d62d-495d-2983-cf1246856bb1.template"
    deployment_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/example_role"

    log_sender_domain = "example-company.org"
    alert_recipients = ["admin1@example-company.org", "admin2@example-company.org"]
    array_model = "V10AR1"
    license_key = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx"

    pureuser_key_pair_name = "cbs_key"

    system_subnet = "subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    replication_subnet = "subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    iscsi_subnet = "subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    management_subnet = "subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

    replication_security_group = "sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    iscsi_security_group = "sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    management_security_group = "sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

    tags = {
        foo = "bar"
        test = "value"
    }
}
