# cbs_array_aws Resource

Allows the deployment and management of a Cloud Block Store instance on AWS. The instance is deployed as a CloudFormation stack.

Refer to the [deployment guide](https://support.purestorage.com/FlashArray/PurityFA/Cloud_Block_Store/Cloud_Block_Store_Deployment_and_Configuration_Guide_for_AWS) for information on how to configure the AWS environment for the CBS instance.

!>Currently, destroying the Terraform resource **will not** deactivate the CBS instance. Due to this,
we recommend that you deactivate the instance from inside the array itself. For information on how
to do this, refer to the [relevant section](https://support.purestorage.com/FlashArray/PurityFA/Cloud_Block_Store/Cloud_Block_Store_Deployment_and_Configuration_Guide_for_AWS#Removing_Cloud_Block_Store) of the guide.
This method is not available for instances at Purity version 5.3.0.aws2 or earlier. If the instance is destroyed by another
method than the one outlined in the guide, including `terraform destroy`, or if the instance is at version 5.3.0.aws2 or earlier,
then you must contact Pure Storage Support in order to deactivate the instance.

~>Updates are currently not supported for this resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "cbs_array_aws" "cbs_example" {

    array_name = "terraform-example-instance"

    deployment_template_url = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsmp-fulfillment-cf-templates-prod/4ea2905b-7939-4ee0-a521-d5c2fcb41214.e6360126-9b9d-4428-a532-e4d22aef7a40.template"
    deployment_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/example_role"

    log_sender_domain = "example-company.org"
    alert_recipients = ["admin1@example-company.org", "admin2@example-company.org"]
    array_model = "V10AR1"
    license_key = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx"

    pureuser_key_pair_name = "cbs_key"
    pureuser_private_key_path = "/path/to/cbs_key"

    system_subnet = "subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    replication_subnet = "subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    iscsi_subnet = "subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    management_subnet = "subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

    replication_security_group = "sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    iscsi_security_group = "sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    management_security_group = "sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

    tags = {
        foo = "bar"
        test = "value"
    }
}
```
