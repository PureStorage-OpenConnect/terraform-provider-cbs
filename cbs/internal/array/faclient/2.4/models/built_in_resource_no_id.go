// BuiltInResourceNoID A built-in resource. Many are singletons predefined by Purity (e.g., support settings). Some correspond to a piece of software, like an app, or hardware, like a controller. Others are created by the system in response to some event (e.g., alerts, audit records).
// Typically, a user can't create, delete or rename a built-in resource. A few can be created or deleted, but not renamed because the names are meaningful to Purity (e.g., VIFs, file systems, file system snapshots, volume snapshot).
